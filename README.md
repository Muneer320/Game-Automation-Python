# Game-Automation-Python

It is a list of three Game Automation projects made with Python which really are fun. Here's a list of them:

i) Dino.py --> It is really the most famous game to be automated, as you all must be knowing about the game from before, in this game there's a trex who is continuously runnig and various obstacles comes on it's way and our task is to protect it against all those. So I automated it so it can protacted itself.

ii) PianoTiles.py --> It is another very famous game that you must be knowing as well. In this game the tiles comes down continuously and our task is to click on all of them before they go out of the canvas. So I automated it to click on the tiles before they disappear.

iii) Stickman.py --> It is another game that just pops the bubbles-like things in which user needs to click before they disappear, it basically is to check how perfect is your aim. So I automated it so that it will automatically click on the bubble once it comes.

Thanks for reading I will try making more such automated game AI in future.
